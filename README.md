Project
A team of max 3 members should implement a REST-based application in Java (using Spring Boot). The service should be able to manage a centrally stored message. It should be able to

deliver the message to a client
set it to a specific message
reset the message
using its API.

Requirements
Use GitHub for the project and follow the correct DevOps procedure. Use a Kanban board to manage your User Stories and use a git branching model (preferable gitflow) to manage your code. Track your development process by updating your Kanban board and write at least one unit tests for every requirement. A Continuous Integration pipeline that produces the finished software artifact should be implemented as well.
